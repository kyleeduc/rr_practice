## How to fold a paper airplane

1. Find a piece of 8.5" by 11" paper.
2. Fold and crease the piece of paper in half to get a 4.25" by 11" sheet of paper.
3. Fold the two top corners of the paper to the first crease created in step 2. You should now have a rectangle with a pointy end.
4. Fold the same two sides again to the first crease to create a sharper point.
5. With the point sitting to the left, fold the top edge down to create the first wing.
6. With the point sitting to the right, fold the top edge down to create the second wing.
7. Adjust the wings so that they are perpendicular with the body of the plane.
8. Toss the plane!
