## How to fold a paper airplane

1. Find a piece of 8.5" by 11" paper.
2. Hold the paper in a "Portrait" orientation and envision a vertical line going down the middle of the paper.
3. Fold and crease the piece of paper in half to get a 4.25" by 11" sheet of paper.
4. After creasing the paper, unfold it.
5. Fold the two top corners of the paper to the first crease created in step 2. You should now have a rectangle with a pointy end.
6. Fold the same two sides again to the first crease to create a sharper point.
7. With the point sitting to the left, fold the top edge down to create the first wing.
8. With the point sitting to the right, fold the top edge down to create the second wing.
9. Adjust the wings so that they are perpendicular with the body of the plane.
10. Toss the plane!
